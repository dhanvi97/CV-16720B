# CV-16720B
Repository for  CV-16720B assignments and experiments

### HW1

In HW1, I implement filtering in python using numpy, in both brute-force and vectorized manners. Using this, I wrote a simple edge detector based on the Hough Transform accumulator, with some simple visualization of line segments at the end

### HW2

In HW2, I use various feature detectors to represent images (harris corner feature responses, GIST, CNN Deep Features and ViT), tested with kMeans clustering and nearest-neighbour clustering to build image recognition systems and compare accuracy

### HW3
